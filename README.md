OGEA API

Flask API on top of OGEA database. 

Before using:

Edit config file to match db settings. 
(Rename as config, not config_template)

Set DEBUG = True to disable authentication and turn on Flask's debug mode.

NOISITE_DOMAIN points to the Django website to be used for validating authentication credentials (i.e. neworganizing.com)
